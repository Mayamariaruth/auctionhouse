## Project Overview

Auction House is an auction platform designed for students at Noroff. It allows registered users to securely create, manage, and participate in auctions while providing a modern, interactive, and responsive interface. The platform emphasizes transparency, ease of use, and community engagement, enabling users to showcase listings, track bids, and manage their profiles with full control over their content and interactions.

## Key Features

- **Create** – Easily create auction listings with a title, detailed description, deadline, and image gallery.
- **Manage** – Edit or delete your own listings at any time.
- **Bidding** – Place bids on other users’ listings, with a live history of all bids for transparency.
- **Credits** – Track your available credits and see your balance updated in real-time.
- **Profile** – Customize your profile with a bio, avatar, and banner. View your listings and bidding history in one place.
- **Search** – Browse and search for listings by title, content, or tags.

### Future Features

- **Wins** - Display won auctions for users.

## API Usage

This project uses the [Noroff API v2](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2) to fetch and manage auction data. The API supports full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete), allowing for dynamic content interaction including listings and profiles.
